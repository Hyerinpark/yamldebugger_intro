Name of Quantlet: yaml_TDM_CorrPlot

Published in: 'yamldebugger: YAML parser debugger according to the QuantNet style guide. R package version 0.5.0.'

Description: 'Visualizes correlations between terms (keywords) of a document-term matrix via Rgraphviz ("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R").
Bioconductor provides tools for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data.
Bioconductor uses the R statistical programming language, and is open source and open development.
The correlation plots use the most frequent words (above the given frequency bound "lowfreq") from the DTM as the nodes
and include the links among words with a correlation above the given threshold "corThreshold".
The words/keywords are taken from document-term matrix DTM which is extracted from the keywords in the YAML meta info in Quantlets.
This might help the user to get an overview of the relevance, connectedness, correlation and frequency of the existing keywords in QuantNet.'

Keywords: 'data mining, optimization, test, standardization, preprocessing, yaml, parser, debugger, quantnet, style guide, package, github,
visualization, descriptive-statistics, correlation, graphical representation, bioconductor'
