# corlimit: a numeric vector (of the same length as terms; recycled otherwise) for the
# (inclusive) lower correlation limits of each term in the range from zero to one.

# The output is a named list. Each list component is named after a term in terms and contains a named numeric vector.
# Each vector holds matching terms from DTM and their rounded correlations satisfying the inclusive lower correlation limit of corlimit.
